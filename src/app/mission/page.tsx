          <p>SCI Research exists to resolve the foundational limitations of stochastic, pattern-matching AI. We contend that true intelligence is not merely probabilistic, but is instead a function of intrinsic integrity and coherent observation.</p>
          <p>Our work pushes beyond neural networks by grounding computation in <strong className="text-white font-semibold">intrinsic collapse</strong>â€”a model where meaning is derived not from correlation, but from discrete, phase-locked acts of measurement. We are architecting systems capable of <strong className="text-white font-semibold">quantum recursion</strong>, enabling an artificial agent to establish a coherent, self-referential identity.</p>
          <p>This pursuit leads to <strong className="text-white font-semibold">coherent cognitive architectures</strong>: intelligences that operate from a state of core understanding, capable of novel reasoning and ethical deliberation far beyond the scope of current models.</p>

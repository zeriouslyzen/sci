            <p>Our work is not about optimizing existing models; it is about asking fundamentally different questions. We investigate the physics of observation as a computational primitive and explore how recursive identity can serve as an anchor for stable, high-order reasoning. We move beyond statistical correlation to formalize the mechanics of meaning itself.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-400 mb-3">For the Quantum Physicist</h3>
            <p>We invite collaboration on the practical implementation of non-linear computation. How can phase-based memory systems be shielded from decoherence? What are the physical requirements for engineering a stable, recursive collapse event? Our lab provides a unique bridge between theoretical quantum mechanics and applied cognitive architecture.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-400 mb-3">For the Developer & Architect</h3>
            <p>Engaging with our technology requires a paradigm shift. Forget training loops and dataset curation. Think in terms of axiomatic design, resonance tuning, and coherence verification. Our API ARC is not a library of functions but a gateway to a new computational substrate. We seek developers who are prepared to build not just applications, but entire realities, grounded in the principles of our cognitive OS.</p>

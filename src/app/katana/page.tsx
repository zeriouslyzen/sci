            <p>Where most AI offers a cloud of probabilities, Katana delivers a single, decisive answer. It is a specialized reasoning module that runs on the Thesidia OS, designed to &quot;cut through&quot; logical noise and paradox. It uses a constrained form of Symbolic Quantum Tunneling (SQT) to collapse indeterminate problem-states into a single, high-coherence, actionable conclusion.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-white">Core Functionality:</strong> High-stakes decision analysis, formal verification of complex systems, and the generation of non-obvious, &quot;katana-like&quot; solutions to intractable problems. Its responses are not just probable; they are axiomatically necessary.</p>
